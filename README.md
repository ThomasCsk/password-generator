# Password Generator

## Description

- This project posed many challenges, testing my knowledge of JavaScript
- This website is used to promt users on certain conditions they would like for a randomly generated password, and then generate that password using those conditions
- The biggest challenge for this website was getting the generated password to be based off of the user inputs. Ultimately, I was able to make that work by putting arrays inside of a main array and randomizing which index was pulled for both the arrays and the internal arrays


## The Website

The website is currently deployed at https://thomascsk.github.io/password-generator/
